React notes
As data updates 
Components can have state 
State-collection of data for our compost to represent data through time
Props
Furteher way to pas data
Parents can send children information
With props component can react within an app with each other
The child will reload data as it responds to changes from the parent
Lifecycle methods
Lifecycle methods/hooks fire during the apps phases

Classes represent object in real life

*** when you are describing object oriented programming

React heavily relies on es6
Create a class
This is used to represent objects using javascript keyword class
These classes have properties which can be attached to the class themselves
In order to describe these properties you can specify class to specify properties 
These can be done with the function constructor which specifies parameter that can be used to specify these properties
Within the body of the constructor we can bind properties by specifying this on the class 
this can be represented by this.property

Let anything = new class (parameters);

console.log(anything); 
This can test the es6 framework to make sure react is working

We can also give classes more behaves through class methods
REACT uses class inheritance from es6

**
Class inheritance
Es6 allows you to define new classes extending the properties from the original class
it uses it in effect as a template
Need to give constructor that is identical to the parent class constructor
super(name, color);
Super function allows you to to call code from the parent class and inherit the functions of it
